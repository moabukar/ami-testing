########################## Winlogbeat Configuration ###########################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see winlogbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/winlogbeat/index.html

#======================= Winlogbeat specific options ==========================

# The registry file is where Winlogbeat persists its state so that the beat
# can resume after shutdown or an outage. The default is .winlogbeat.yml
# in the directory in which it was started.
winlogbeat.registry_file: C:/ProgramData/winlogbeat/.winlogbeat.yml

# event_logs specifies a list of event logs to monitor as well as any
# accompanying options. The YAML data type of event_logs is a list of
# dictionaries.
#
# The supported keys are name (required), tags, fields, fields_under_root,
# forwarded, ignore_older, level, event_id, provider, and include_xml. Please
# visit the documentation for the complete details of each option.
# https://go.es.io/WinlogbeatConfig
winlogbeat.event_logs:
  - name: System
  - name: Application
    ignore_older: 48h
    level: critical, error, warning
    include_xml: true



#================================ Outputs ======================================

#------------------------------- File output -----------------------------------
output.file:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  enabled: true

  # Path to the directory where to save the generated files. The option is
  # mandatory.
  path: "E:/winlogbeat/logs"

  # Name of the generated files. The default is `winlogbeat` and it generates
  # files: `winlogbeat`, `winlogbeat.1`, `winlogbeat.2`, etc.
  filename: winlogbeat

  # Maximum size in kilobytes of each file. When this size is reached, and on
  # every winlogbeat restart, the files are rotated. The default value is 10240
  # kB.
  rotate_every_kb: 10000

  # Maximum number of files under path. When this number of files is reached,
  # the oldest file is deleted and the rest are shifted from last to first. The
  # default is 7 files.
  number_of_files: 7

  # Permissions to use for file creation. The default is 0600.
  permissions: 0600

#================================= Paths ======================================

# The home path for the winlogbeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all other path settings and for miscellaneous files that come with the
# distribution (for example, the sample dashboards).
# If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
# home path is the location of the binary.
#path.home:

# The configuration path for the winlogbeat installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config: ${path.home}

# The data path for the winlogbeat installation. This is the default base path
# for all the files in which winlogbeat needs to store its data. If not set by a
# CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
# subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.data: ${path.home}/data
path.data: D:/winlogbeat/data

# The logs path for a winlogbeat installation. This is the default location for
# the Beat's log files. If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file,
# the default for the logs path is a logs subdirectory inside the home path.
path.logs: E:/winlogbeat/beat/logs


#================================ Logging ======================================
# There are four options for the log output: file, stderr, syslog, eventlog
# The file output is the default.

# Sets log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, debug
logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", "service"
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: false

# Send all logging output to Windows Event Logs. The default is false.
#logging.to_eventlog: false

# If enabled, winlogbeat periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is true.
#logging.metrics.enabled: true

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# Logging to rotating files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.
logging.to_files: true
logging.files:
  # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
  # under the home path (the binary location).
  path: E:/winlogbeat/logs

  # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
  name: winlogbeat_beat

  # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
  # automatically rotated
  rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

  # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
  keepfiles: 7

  # The permissions mask to apply when rotating log files. The default value is 0600.
  # Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in octal notation.
  #permissions: 0644

# Set to true to log messages in json format.
#logging.json: false
